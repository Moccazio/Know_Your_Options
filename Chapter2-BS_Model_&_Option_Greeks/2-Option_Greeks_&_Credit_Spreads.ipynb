    "Sigma $\\sigma$: The implied volatility is a measure the estimate of how much the price could change. A high number means that traders believe the option could make a large change. Basically, just a volatility index.\n",
    "Delta: The $\\delta$ measures how much the option price would change in relation to the underlying stock price. A delta of 0.5 means the option would change 50 cents for every 1 dollar the stock moves. $\\delta$ is the first derivative of the price.\n",
    "Gamma: The $\\gamma$ measures how fast the Delta will change when the stock price changes. A high number means this is a very explosive option, and could gain or loss value quickly. This is the second derivative of the price.\n",
    "Theta: The $\\theta$ measures how fast the option is losing value per day due to time decay. As the expiration day arrives, the theta increases.\n",
    "Vega: The vega (a measure of how sensitive the option price is to a change in the implied volatility. Options that are way out of the money, or have a long time until expiration are more sensitive to a change in implied volatility)"
